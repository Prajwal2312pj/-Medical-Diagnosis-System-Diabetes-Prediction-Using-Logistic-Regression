# -Medical-Diagnosis-System-Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project is a Machine Learning-based Diabetes Prediction System built using Logistic Regression. It uses patient health parameters like glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The model was trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and deployed using a Flask web application.
